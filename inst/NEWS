2010-03-11:
  - fixed bugs in mtable and format.mtable. Short 'summary.stats'
    arguments or 'summary.stats=FALSE' should work now.

2010-03-06:
  - fixed but in genTable/percentage: total counts disappeared if
    a factor level had the same name as the name given to the total count
  - changed the default value of the 'digits' option of the matrix method
    of the toLatex generic to the more sensible getOption("digits")
  - the matrix method of the toLatex generic gains new optional arguments
    'show.vars', 'show.xvar', and 'show.yvar', which determine whether
    the name of the row and/or the column variable should be shown if
    the matrix is a 2-dimensional table.

2010-03-02:
  - fixed minor but in 'cases' function

2009-11-11:
  - correction bug in .unLoad function.

2009-10-14:
  - removed 'extended' arguments from calls to 'regexpr' and 'sub' etc. (for compatibility
    with R 2.11)

2009-08-19:
  - corrected documentation for mtable (\usepackage instead of usepackage)
  - completed documentation for contrasts generic
  - fixed bug in the internals for 'spss.portable.file':
    'SPSS Por' to ascii and 'SPSS Por' to integer translation tables
    were one item too short.

2009-06-02:
  - as.factor methods for item vectors adapted to new factor function
    in R 2.10.0
  - Fixed bug in sample.data.frame and sample.data.set methods:
    Samples were drawn only from the first m observations, where m is
    the number of variables in the data frame/data set.
